# Authentication with jwt - tuto
###### Using Netninja playlist [Node.js Auth Tutorial (JWT)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9iqqESP8335DA5cRFp8loyp)

# JWT 
Stands for JSON Web Tokens.

# Defining Auth Routes
Route | Method | Utility
------|-------|---------
/signup | GET | sign up page
/login | GET | log in page
/signup | POST | create a new user in db
/login | POST | authenticate a current user
/logout | GET | log a user out

# Postman
A tool to simulate requests when we don't have a server :D

# Mongoose Validation

We can use our own functions to validate stuff we want, but we also can use a 3rd party tool that does the job. 
`npm install validator`

###### N.B if the validator doesn't have a specific message property, we could define the error message just like in the line 9 of [this file](https://github.com/locust49/nodejs-tuto/blob/jwt/controllers/authController.js)

# Mongoose Hooks

Hooks are used to fire code at different points when documents are saved to database.

# Hashing Passwords (bcrypt)

Oh, so now I can see everyone's password and .. * *thinking of evil things* *

**No !**
Passwords should be hashed in order to protect our user's data if ever our database got compromised. 

To do that, we'll be using bcrype.

`npm install bcrypt`

Hashing is a one way process, but again, it doesn't mean that a hashing algorithm can't be reversed. Reason why we should use a "salt" to the string we want to hash

# Cookies üç™üç™

`npm install cookie-parser`

# The theory of everything.. ish 

JWT is made of 3 parts:
<pre>
Headers		| Tells the server what type of signature is being used (meta data about the token)
Payload		| Is used to identify the user (user id but no sensitive data)
Signature	| Makes the token secure (== stamp of authenticity)
</pre>
## [JWT Signature](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZq0G8WUaII)

<pre>
Headers _
	 | _ Hashed together _ Secret *(the only way to verify a token + stored in the server)*
Payload _|	|
		|
 	   Signature
</pre>

When the Header, Payload and the secure Secret string are hashed together, they create the token **signature** which is added to the end of the jwt after the Headers and Payload.

`Headers.Payload.Signature`

Our JWT is then added into a cookie and sent and stored in a browser.

Seems hard and complicated.. but I heard it might be easier with the help of a package ...

# New User Signup

`npm install jsonwebtoken`

Now, we can easily create a jwt with the method `jwt.sign()` where we specify the payload, secret sentence ? (i still don't get this part), and some atrtibutes such as the expiration time. After that, we send the token via a cookie :D
